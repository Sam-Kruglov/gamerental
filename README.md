# Game Rental Application

## Description

The "Game Rental" application showcases how Axon Framework and Axon Server can be used during software development.
The domain which is focused on is that of rental services from the perspective of a video game store. 

This repository provides just such an application, albeit a demo rather than a full fledged solution.
It serves a personal purpose of having a stepping stone application to live code during application.
My intent is to build upon this sample during consecutive talks, further enhancing its capabilities and implementation as time progresses.
For others, I hope this provides a simple and quick look into what it means to build an Axon-based application.
 
Due to its nature of being based on Axon, it will incorporate DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, and an overall messaging solution to communicate between distinct components.
 
## Project Traversal

Distinct branches will be (made) available per public speaking, sharing a start and final solution branch separately.
Additionally, several branches representing the steps throughout the lifecycle of the "Game Rental" application will be present, allowing you to:
* Check out the exact step you are interested in.
* Perform a `git reset --hard step#` to reset your current branch.

Next to providing the convenience of showing the flow, it also serves the purpose of being a back-up during the presentation.

The following steps have been defined for this project:
